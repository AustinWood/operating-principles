# Operating Principles

This repo is a living document of my own life and work operating principles à la Ray Dalio.

For now, it is just the one README.

"Look to nature to learn how reality works." - Ray Dalio
"The best way to deduce the system's purpose is to watch it for a while to see how the system behaves." - Donella Meadows

"A set of feedback loops that can restore or rebuild feedback loops is reisilience at a still higher level – meta-resilience."
